#+TITLE: Ren'Py mode

PyTom's old major mode for Ren'Py, previously maintained by treymerkley, now maintained by me.

** Installation

  Either install within Emacs directly from MELPA or:
  * Download/clone this repo to your desired location.
  * In Emacs, use the command =M-x package-install-file= and point it to the renpy.el file location
    * This will install it to your =~/.emacs.d/elpa/= directory (or your custom location if you've manually set a different =package-user-dir= in Emacs)
  * In your .emacs file, add =(require 'renpy)=

** History

Originally this was PyTom's major mode for Ren'Py but he no longer uses Emacs or Ren'Py anymore. Then maintenance was taken over by Trey Merkley @treymerkley but he was looking for someone else to take it on who was more familiar with Elisp. So now it is maintained by me.

Come at me, parentheses. I dare you.
